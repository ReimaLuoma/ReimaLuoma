# 👋 Hi, I'm Reima Luoma

**Frontend Developer** aspiring to become a **Full Stack Developer**  
Typescript & React are my comfort zone — but I'm always up for a challenge.

### 🛠️ Tech I Use  
- 🧠 **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript  
- ⚛️ **Frontend:** React, Vite, MUI  
- 🌩️ **Backend (Learning):** Node.js, Serverless Framework (AWS)  
- 🧪 **State Management:** React Context, learning MobX  
- 🧰 **Other Tools:** i18next, Chart.js, Biome, GitHub Actions

### 📦 Current Project  
I'm working on **Ruunel**, a personal library web app for tracking your own collection of movies, books, or any physical items.

> 🔗 [Check out the dev version at dev.ruunel.com](https://dev.ruunel.com)

It's my playground for trying out full-stack concepts like sharing access codes, custom permissions, and serverless backend logic.

### 🎯 Always Learning  
I like to build things from scratch — even if it means rewriting them once or twice (looking at you, Roommate 👀).  
My current learning goals include backend development and scalable architectures.

### ✨ A Bit About Me  
> _Jack of all Trades_

I love connecting dots between design, logic, and user experience. I also enjoy iterating until things just **feel right**.
