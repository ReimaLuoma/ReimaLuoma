### 📦 Current Project

I'm working on **Ruunel**, a personal library web app for tracking your own collection of movies, books, or any physical items.

> 🔗 [Check out the dev version at dev.ruunel.com](https://dev.ruunel.com)

It's my playground for trying out full-stack concepts like sharing access codes, custom permissions, and serverless backend logic.

### 🎯 Always Learning

I like to build things from scratch — even if it means rewriting them once or twice (looking at you, Roommate 👀).  
My current learning goals include backend development and scalable architectures.

### ✨ A Bit About Me

> _Jack of all Trades_

I love connecting dots between design, logic, and user experience. I also enjoy iterating until things just **feel right**.
